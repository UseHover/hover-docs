# Hover SDK Version 2

The version 2 of the SDK is a work in progress. In terms of functionality it is not significantly different from version 1, however it will support both custom actions and "global actions" which are created and maintained by Hover so that developers do not have to create there own configurations. The reference for those actions can be found in the [channel reference](/channel-reference). On the Android side, the main difference is the use of more modern APIs, primarily a Room database.

#### Install the V2 SDK

Using the v2 is simply a matter of changing the Hover maven repo to point to our snapshots in your root level build.gradle file: "http://maven.usehover.com/snapshots". In your app level build.gradle set the Hover SDK version to the appropriate value. Currently there are different versions depending on whether you want to use custom actions or our global actions. For custom actions set the dependency to '2.0.0-alpha1.0.4'. For global actions `2.0.0-stax-1.9.0.3`.

#### Use the V2 SDK

You can now access the Action and SIM databases directly. Eventually the same will be true of the Transaction DB as well.
