# Hover Runner (Previously Tester App)

Hover runner is a lightweight app that allows you to test actions on a real Android device and SIM card. You can visit your Hover dashboard to download a precompiled APK. The precompiled APK includes an API key linked to your account so you can test actions without writing code. 

To maintain high security standards, the APK on your dasbhoard is precompiled for your account alone. Only the login credentials to your dashboard can work for the app. You cannot use your correct login details on another account's Runner app.
